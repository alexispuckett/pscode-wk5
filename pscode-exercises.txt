// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

check if number is divisible by 2


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
num1, num2, num3, num4, num5 
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 = num6 / 5 = num7
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers. 
print num1, num 2, num3, num4, num5
IF num5 > num1 through num5 THEN num5= largest number is TRUE
IF num1 < num2 through num5 THEN num1 = smallest number is TRUE

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

b. num7 = average of num1 through num5
print num7
c. IF num5 is > total of num THEN num5 is largest number
   IF num1 is < all numbers THEN num1 is smallest number
